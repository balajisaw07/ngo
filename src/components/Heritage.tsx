    <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-100">VĀRASĀ – Association of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology holds the firm belief that protecting our tangible and intangible heritage is not just a responsibility, but a mission rooted in preserving the soul of our civilization. Guided by its vision to safeguard cultural legacy for future generations, VĀRASĀ actively works to conserve monuments, artifacts, traditional practices, and indigenous knowledge systems. The association emphasizes that true heritage protection can only be achieved through meaningful engagement with local communities, who are the living custodians of traditions, and through collaborative efforts with government departments, policy-makers, and academic institutions. By creating awareness, organizing heritage walks, capacity-building workshops, and promoting research and documentation, VĀRASĀ bridges the gap between people and their past. Its vision is to foster a culture where heritage is not merely observed but lived, celebrated, and protected through a shared sense of pride and responsibility.</p>
